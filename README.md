## Blockups

> A starter kit for building sharable React UI libraries

### Commands

`yarn build` Build bundled packages

`yarn test:watch` Run tests in development

`yarn test` Run tests on CI platforms

`yarn storybook` Run storybook locally

`yarn storybook:export` Build a static instance of storybook to deploy somewhere

### Notes

New components need to be added to `index.ts` manually as a safeguard from accidentally bundling unfinished code
